Hi there! In a past life I was a lead engineer behind Salesforce Topics powering tagging in core CRM product and backbone for Community Cloud.  


I am currently testing my startup chops interested in working on messaging, personalization, and discovery. I am passionate about building useful software.


My latest project is [Clarkson](https://clarksonapp.com) - a smarter release notes platform.
