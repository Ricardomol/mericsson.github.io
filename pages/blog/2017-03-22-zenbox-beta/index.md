Finally proud to announce the launch of the [zenbox.co](https://zenbox.co) beta!

I built zenbox.co to solve email overload. I am an [Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero) geek and methodically bring my gmail inbox back to zero emails.

With the amount of email overload we all experience, this is an extremely tiresome task without any tools. Google's Inbox product is a solution that can help but I believe it falls short. That is because while it does a great job organizing your email into categories, it does not actually remove them from your inbox context. That means you spend brain power processing them even while knowing they are not important. Also, while I think Google's Inbox machine learning approach is innovative and very intelligent, ultimately it works as a black box. In my opinion, your email inbox is too personal to ever allow a black box to control it.

For these reasons, I needed a new solution. zenbox.co uses a rule-based system to keep your inbox tidy. At this stage, it supports three types of whitelist filters: Trusted Senders, Trusted Domains, and Trusted Mailing Lists. Any email you receive that does not match an entry in a whitelist filter is moved from your inbox.

Trusted Senders is the list of individual email addresses which you trust to send you emails. This would likely include your friends, family, and coworkers. This list is populated dynamically when you sign up for zenbox.co and enable processing. It looks at all the recipients of emails you have sent and adds them to the Trusted Senders list.

Trusted Domains allows you to trust (or whitelist) entire domains. For example, you may work at a company with email domain 'acmecorp.com'. In this case, you may want to keep all 'acmecorp.com' emails in your inbox. You can do this by adding a Trusted Domain entry 'acmecorp.com'.

Trusted Mailing Lists are for those important mailing lists you are on. This works especially well for Google Groups. Just add the google group email address (e.g. soccer-buddies@googlegroups.com) and all emails sent to that address will stay in your inbox.

While there may be more zenbox.co trusted email strategies in the future, these three functions should cover a broad set of use cases.
